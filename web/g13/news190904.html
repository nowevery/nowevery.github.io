			<div class="title">About IECQ QC080000：2017</div>
			 IECQ QC 080000 is the “Electrical and Electronic Components and Products Hazardous Substance Process Management System Requirements” (HSPM) published by the International Electro technical Commission (IEC). The current version, i.e. IECQ QC 080000:2017, is established by extending the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System standards. This standard provides a sound solution for the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS), Waste Electrical and the Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directives, and other hazardous substances management systems. Established to achieve the HSF goal, IECQ QC080000 integrates product and process management to fuse green production with enterprises to prevent potential risks from RoHS and WEEE and thereby avoid sales and market losses and help enterprises to achieve control over restricted hazardous substances. It also enables stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, repair and service providers, etc. to identify, restrict, control and report the contents of hazardous substances contained in the products manufactured or supplied, and for customers and users to understand the status of such hazardous substances not in products and acknowledge the sources of hazardous substances in products.
