			 IATF 16949:2016 defines the requirements of a quality management system for organizations in the automotive industry and was developed by International Automotive Task Force (IATF) based on the framework of the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System. It is applicable to organizations of automotive manufacture, production parts, and servicing parts, especially the automotive manufacturers and organizations which produces related automotive materials as well as assembly parts, or provides heat treatment, welding, electroplating, coating or related services for the automotive industry.
		<br><br>
			According to the official guide published by Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), the first step to the best quality road for the automotive industry is 5 core tools, including APQP, PPAP, FMEA, SPC, and MSA. The five Automotive Quality Core Tools are the building blocks of an effective quality management system.
